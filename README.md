Alternate lighting models using custom SCNProgram for SceneKit


A demo app for previewing alternate lighting models using a custom SCNProgram with SceneKit. Based on a Quartz Composer conversion of NVIDIA samples from toneburst([machinesdontcare.wordpress.com](http://machinesdontcare.wordpress.com)). 

A [short video](https://vimeo.com/1006634143) of the app in action.

10.10+ since I wanted to play with new OSX View Controller API. Lot's of code cleanup needed.
